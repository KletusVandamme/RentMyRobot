## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: User Authentication (0.5 day)
In this phase I will implement user authentication in Rails.

[Details][phase-one]

### Phase 2: robot/show, robot/index (1 day)
In this phase I will:
- Create some rudimentary seed data and populate my database.
- Create the BB show view for a single robot, including robot details and an image.

[Details][phase-two]

### Phase 3: robot map view (1 days)
In this phase I will implement the google map view that accompanies the robots index view.

[Details][phase-three]

### Phase 4: robot/index - filtering tools (1 days)
In this phase I will integrate the GUI tools that allow the user to filter the list of robots by price or type.

[Details][phase-four]

### Phase 5: comments/create, comments/show (1 days)
In this phase I will create a view that allows the user to add a comment to a robot's show page.  I will also edit the robot's show page so that it includes a subView of all the comments for that robot.

[Details][phase-five]

### Phase 6: like/create, like/show (1 days)
In this phase I will allow the user to "like" a robot.  There will be a small outline of a heart on the corner of each robot's image.  If they click this, the heart will become solid and the robot have a has_many relationship with a like model in the database.

[Details][phase-six]

### Phase 7: robot_likes/show (1 days)
In this phase I will create the view that show all the robots that the user has "liked".  This will probably be just a filtered index view.

### Phase 8: Styling (2 days)
In this phase I will implement the CSS and backbone styling.ÃŸ

[Details][phase-eight]

### Phase 9: Add non-critical feeatures (1 days)
In this phase I will complete punch list items that were depriotitized in order to prove out the core functionality.  These include the ability to edit and delete comments.

[Details][phase-nine]
